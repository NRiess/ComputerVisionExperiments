# ComputerVisionExperiments

This repository contains several computer vision experiments. 
Most of them where conducted using:
* OpenCV
* numpy
* matplotlib
* PyTorch
* scikit-learn

For the sake of clarity, all the images and image folders can be found in the Data folder. They either need to be extracted from the folder into the same notebook that you run or you adjust the path of the data that has to be loaded.
